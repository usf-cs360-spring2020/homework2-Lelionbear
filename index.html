        This page consists of an overview of data collected for homework 2 from my Data Visualization class.
        The home page also includes information about dataset used in visualizations.
        <br><br>
        For this homework assignment I visualized data from "Baseline Cross-Sectional Estimates of Child and Parent Income Distributions by College"
        from the "Mobility Report Cards: The Role of Colleges in Intergenerational Mobility" website.
        With this collected data I created Parallel Coordinate visualizations in RawGraphs (prototype) and d3.js (version 5).
        </p>

        <h2 id="data">Data</h2>

        <p>The data set used was from <a href=https://opportunityinsights.org/paper/mobilityreportcards/>"Mobility Report Cards: The Role of Colleges in Intergenerational Mobility"</a> and it shows the mobility statistics for students transitioning from a lower quintile fo the median income to a higher quintile.
        Data collected are from students in the 1980, 1981 and 1982 birth cohorts. When data for a college from any of these cohorts are incomplete, we use data from 1983 and 1984 cohorts to obtain an estimate.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            This data is made available under opportunityinsights.org
          </p>
          <cite>As part of our research studies, we put out publicly available datasets that can be used by other researchers and practitioners to support their own work. These datasets allow you to analyze social mobility and a variety of other
            outcomes from life expectancy to patent rates by neighborhood, college, parental income level, and racial background. You can search for datasets by geographic level (e.g., Census tracts), by topic (e.g., education), or by the title of
            the paper. Need technical assistance with these data? Contact us at <a href="mailto:info@opportunityinsights.org">info@opportunityinsights.org</a></cite>
